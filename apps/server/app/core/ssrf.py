"""SSRF guard for outbound HTTP targets from hook scripts (http_get/http_post).

A hook script can be triggered via the *unauthenticated* public webhook, with the
target URL taken straight from the attacker-controlled payload (see the shipped
docs/examples/webhook_http_import.py). Resolve the URL and reject it if it points
at a private/reserved/link-local address, so a webhook holder cannot make the
server fetch internal targets (cloud metadata 169.254.169.254, internal admin
APIs) and reflect the response back. Mirrors the monitoring service's guard.
